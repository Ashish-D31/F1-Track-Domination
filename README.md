# Overview
The F1 Telemetry Data Visualization project is a Streamlit-based web application designed to offer an interactive and visually engaging analysis of Formula 1 race telemetry data. This tool allows users to compare the performance of two drivers during a selected Grand Prix session, providing insights into how each driver performs across different sections of the track.

## Steps to run
1. Navigate to the directory where the repository is downloaded and open a terminal.
2. Install all packages mentioned in requirements.txt using "pip install -r requirements.txt".
3. In the same terminal run the command "Streamlit run TrackDomination.py".
4. Now enter your desired Year, Grand Prix, Session and Driver Codes.

## Note
The Track plotted, will not represent the actual track layout, instead it represents the racing lines taken by drivers.<br>
Do not confuse the plotted Track with actual Track Layout
